# Snake-Retro-Game
The Snake-Retro-Game is a simple game formed using HTML,CSS and Javascript. Basically we have a grid in which a snake can move and grab food to grow itself linearly. It
continues till it crosses itself or hit any of the sidewalls of the grid. This game can be played easily by loading the localhost live server in one's pc.

This repository mainly contains 3 files that are index.html, index.css and script.js along with some music files(mp3).
